# Machine Learning Katas

This site contains a series of mostly self-correcting challenges (_katas_) for practicing your Machine Learning and Deep Learning skills. The associated textbook can be found [here](https://www.bpesquet.fr/mlhandbook).

This material is inspired by a large number of sources, from which numerous ideas and several illustrations were borrowed. More details [here](./appendix/acknowledgments.md).

```{admonition} Interactivity
:class: tip
From any kata, you can launch a live session in the cloud by pressing the <i class="fas fa-rocket" title="rocket"></i> button in the toolbar above and selecting a hosted runtime environment. You will be able to test the code and regenerate the chapter output.
