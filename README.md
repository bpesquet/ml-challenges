# â›© Machine Learning Katas

> This project is being phased out and replaced by [ainotes](https://github.com/bpesquet/ainotes).

This repository contains the source files for the [Machine Learning Katas](https://www.bpesquet.fr/mlkatas), a series of challenges for practicing your Machine Learning and Deep Learning skills.

## Usage

The katas are mostly self-correcting [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) that can be executed either:

- online, by accessing the [katas website](https://bpesquet.github.io/mlkatas/).

- locally, by cloning or downloading this repository then spinning up a Jupyter notebook server on your local machine.

## Development notes

### Adding katas

The katas are generated by [nbgrader](https://nbgrader.readthedocs.io) from completed versions that live in a separate, private repository.

### Generating the site

The [website](https://www.bpesquet.fr/mlkatas) is generated by [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org). After installing it, execute the following command in the root folder to generate the HTML output in the `_build` subdirectory:

```bash
jupyter-book build .
```

A [GitHub action](.github/workflows/deploy.yaml) is used to publish this output as a website.
